<h1>Overview of One Punch Man</h1>


<hr><p> Hello friends! You have come to the right place if you are a<strong><i> One Punch Man</i></strong> fan.</p>

<main><p> Saitama, the main character of the anime series <i>One Punch Man</i> is fed up with this this society of evil monsters always wreaking havoc to the cities. So he trains really really hard, to the point that his hair falls out, and obtains unimaginable strength! He joins this agency that recruits heroes, because he wants to be a just for fun and as well, to get money. He slowly climbs up the ranks, because he, from time and time again, single handedly defeats all of these incredibly strong monsters and soon gets recognized by the agency.</p></main>
<p>For now, he is currently a B rank, the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest rank. We will get into the ranking system later! Saitama is very inspirational and there's a very powerful quote that he says in the anime; it goes like this:<q>Human beings are strong because we have the ability to change ourselves.</q> We can never forget what does it mean to be Saitama? <dl><dt><b>Saitama</b></dt><dd>It means he is the strongest of them<b><em> all</em></b>!!!</dd></dl></p>
