<h1>Computer Operating Systems</h1>
<dl>
	<dt>Operating System</dt><dd>The main software of a computer that allow you to perform simple tasks</dd><br>
	<dt>Batch Processing</dt><dd>Is when a program does a large amount of work in the background without the user having to do anything, like collecting usage data.</dd><br>
	<dt>Timesharing</dt><dd>This is when mutliple people share the same computer, as in they can all access the machine at the sametime.</dd><br>
	<dt>Multitasking</dt><dd>This means the computer can execute more than 1 task at the sametime.</dd><br>
	<dt>Multiprocessing</dt><dd>Computers can run more than 2 programs or instructions at the sametime.</dd><br>
	<dt>Computer Architecture</dt><dd>Cache, CPU, Hardware, Machine Instruction Cycle, Main Memory, Network, Peripheral, RAM</dd><br>
	<dt>Operating System Structure</dt><dd>There are 2 ways am operating system can run; 1st: Human User to Application Software to Operating System to Other System Software to Hardware; 2nd: Human User to Operating System to Hardware </dd><br>
	<dt>System Boot</dt><dd>It boots up big programs, such as the operating system.</dd><br>
	<dt>CISC vs RISC</dt><dd>Complex Instruction Set Computer(CISC): single instructions can execute low level operations; Reduced Instruction Set Computer(RISC): is a computer that uses the CPU to make the instructions easier to read to make the processing quick</dd>
