<h2 class="first">Our Purpose</h2>

<main>Welcome to the Washington-Lee National Honors Society. Here we will talk about something that I don't know about, so I will be writing random stuff to fill up this space like so. I will take over the Earth and take everyone under me and henchmen and will kill anyone who attempts to betray me or escape. Beware humans for I, The Great Saitama, will come to you without warning, so prepare yourselves. Welcome to the Washington-Lee National Honors Society.
